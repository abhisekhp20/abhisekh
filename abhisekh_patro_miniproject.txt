Respected Sir/Madam
apologies for sending the project pretty late.Actually i was waiting for a reply from coderbyte as 
i encountered a tech problem here as to complete the project i had to download docker file 
but since it didnt ran without restarting the system which will lead to me being not able to submit
the assesment so i tried using colab but there i could use docker properly so i tried docker webservice 

but it was also time limited and i doubted that if i share the links of that too by the time it got 
assesed it might have been deleted so i kept trying to see other ways then i worked on the things asked
on web service and was waiting for a reply from tech team of coderbyte whom i mailed yesterday
but i didnot get anything so i am submitting this text file and will explain how i will approach the
problem

1)we can create a git repo by first creating an account on git hub then we have to select which file 
code we want to share so for the same file we will find its path and then we will copy that path.
Then we go to git hub and create new repo and give it a name and other things like keeping it pub or
private,etc.
Then we open our cmd promt and there we set its path to the local folder path which has all the source 
code files.

Then we type>> git in it>> to intiate local folder as local git repo and then we use
command>>then git add .>> to add all files to this local repo folder from local folder
and then we will commit these files using>>git commit -m "first commit" and then we have to add a url 
of the git repo which is at the repo that we create at git hub and paste it here
>>git remote add origin URL
then push the code to git hub using >>git push -u origin master
then it will ask for the user id and password then it will be updated at the github.
 
2)To add postgres to docker container we use command>>
>>docker run --abhi some-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -d postgres
this will download the postgress image into the container 

3)Then we can add jupyter labnotebook image into another container by creating another instance and 
then  using command>>docker run -p 8888:8888 jupyter/scipy-notebook:33add21fab64
this will create an image of jupyter notebook in container.

4)we can make a connection between two containers through their network ids or there host names
so that they can share data with each other.
